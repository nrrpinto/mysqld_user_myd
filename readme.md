### My version

The difference from the original from @feix, is that the user must set the file location as a parameter.
The advantage is from a forensic perspective, analysts can use it without editing the source code. 
Works in Windows or Linux, did not try in iOS virus operating system.

License is the same, all credits to @feix

### user.MYD file parser
